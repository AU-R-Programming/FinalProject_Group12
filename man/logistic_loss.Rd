\title{Logistic Loss Function}
\usage{
logistic_loss(beta, X, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta}{A numeric vector of coefficients for the logistic regression model.}

\item{X}{A numeric matrix of predictor variables.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of binary response variables (0 or 1).}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar representing the logistic loss value.
}
\description{
Computes the logistic loss for a given set of coefficients, predictor variables, and binary response variables.
The logistic loss is the negative log-likelihood of the logistic regression model, used as an objective function for optimization.

\examples{
beta <- c(0.5, -0.2) # Example coefficients
X <- matrix(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), ncol = 2) # Predictors with intercept column
y <- c(0, 1, 1, 0) # Binary responses
logistic_loss(beta, X, y)
